# SQL Injection Exploit

This Python script demonstrates an `SQL` injection exploit. It exploits a vulnerability in a target `API` endpoint to retrieve sensitive information by injecting malicious `SQL` queries.

## Usage

1. Ensure that Python3 is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install requests
```

3. Open the `sql-inject.py` file and replace the IP address (`10.10.10.10`) in the URL with the target API endpoint.
4. Run the script using the following command:
```
python3 sql-inject.py
```
The script will execute the exploit and display the results.

## Features

- Exploits an SQL injection vulnerability in the target API endpoint.
- Retrieves sensitive information by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- Implements a simple retry mechanism to bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).
- Discovers the target domain and Domain SID using UNION-based SQL injection.
- Enumerates user accounts associated with the Domain SID.
- Utilizes hexadecimal encoding and Unicode escape sequences for payload injection.

## Limitations

- This script assumes a specific vulnerability and may not work against all SQL injection scenarios.
- It is designed for educational purposes and may require modifications for use in real-world scenarios.
- Use with caution and only on systems where you have proper authorization.
